Use of different Supervised Machine Learning techniques to make survival prediction of the passengers on the Titanic

This is off a Kaggle Machine Learning competition using the legendary Titanic dataset. The competition aims to use machine learning techniques 
to build a model that predict which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.

"The Challenge
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, 
there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” 
using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc)." (Kaggle)

The data is split into a train and test sets. Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 records) with information
whether they survived the sinking of the ship or not.
Test.csv on the other hand contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It is on this data set that we shall make predictions.

Data Dictionary
Variable	Definition	Key
survival	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex	Sex	
Age	Age in years	
sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket	Ticket number	
fare	Passenger fare	
cabin	Cabin number	
embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.

The Techniques employed for the predictions are:
1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forest
3. Lasso-Ridge Regression
4. Linear Support Vector Machines
5. Radial Support Vector Machine
6. Logistic Regression
